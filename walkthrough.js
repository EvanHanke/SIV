This is an abbreviated walkthrough that skips most of the quests and serves as a reference for how to
finish the game most efficiently.<br>
<h4>1: The Moon Temple</h4>
The first area of the game serves to implicitly teach inventory management and
spell casting. First, take the western platform to the garden room. Ringing the bell
will cause time to pass and the budding flowers to grow. Talk to the Snail and it will
explain the scent of the blooming flowers woke them up. They will thank you and give you gardening shears.
Take some flowers with you (press Z to collect them) and return to the center room. Take the platform east to the
room with the sleeping owl. Plant flowers around the owl and ring the bell. The owl will wake up,
and teach you a spell. You will be asked to name the spell. After you name it, press T to type in
the name again. This will cast the spell, creating a magic carpet which allows you to reach the key
in the eastern box. <br><br>
Return to the center room, then take the moving platform south. You can now enter the gate which
was previously locked. You will have to use your spell to navigate across the next room, whose
islands are strewn apart. Travel along the eastern rim of islands using your spell. <br><br>
In the next room you find the sleeping druid. Plant flowers around them and then ring the bell.
They will wake up and explain that your dreams are threatened by a parasite. They will give you a worm egg.
<h4>2: Byrd Town</h4>
Travel south from the Moon Temple into Byrd Town. You will find strange purple monsters blocking the nearby houses
and southern door. There is a scientist by the southern door who asks you to hatch a worm egg.<br>
To hatch a worm egg, place the egg on the ground away from the parasites and pick up any nearby trash. Then surround
the egg with flowers and ring the bell. A worm will hatch and move towards the parasites, eating them. It will eat
one a day so ring the bell to refresh it's hunger. <br>
After unlocking the passage south, move into the Byrd Cliffs and seek Owlin on the south-western
cliff. They will tell you that you need to get your worm to hatch another egg. Simply keep passing time
until the worm eats 7 parasites or dead flowers. After this, collect the egg it lays. Owlin will tell you
to take the egg south and seek the help of the Lytle Spirits of the forest. They have a boat which will allow
you to search for your dreams. Grow 10 yellow flowers to take with you before you leave.
<h4>3: The Forest </h4>
Leave Byrd Cliffs and travel south across floating pillars to the forest island. A mushroom headed Lytle Spirit
stands guard and asks for a payment of 10 yellow flowers before entering. Pay and enter. Inside, move east and find the
strange orb. Press Z and it will teleport you to the Lytle Spirit Temple. Enter the center room to speak with the Chief.
The Chief will ask you to find their missing weaver in return for a boat. Leave. Visit the western building. There is a Shaman
inside. Do as they ask until they teach you the protection spell you need. Leave. To the south-west of the temple is a passage
upwards. Climb the cylinders until you reach the vengeful forest guardians who throw leaves at you. Cast your protection spell
and head east. Enter the upper eastern door. Move forward and touch the strange orb. You will have to navigate a maze of teleporting orbs.
From the first platform you are teleported to, drop down to the one below it. Take that orb to the top of the tree. Move horizontally
and take the heighest western orb to find the weaver. Talk to the weaver and take them back to the temple. The Chief will thank you.
Leave the forest.

<h4>4: Ocean Town</h4>
Outside the forest you will find a boat prepared for you by the Lytle Spirits. Use it by pressing Z and head north-east.
There is a whirlpool which leads to Ocean Town. You will find the entrance to Ocean Town blocked by a parasite.
Hatch a worm egg and move forward. Once inside the town, pass time until the worm eats the parasite blocking the
northern door. You must pay several flowers to the guard to enter the door. Beyond the door is the entrance to the
Sunken City.

<h4>5: The Sunken City</h4>
Follow the floating path as it spirals counter clockwise upwards and move through the door. You will find yourself
in the Sunken City with several paths available for exploration. You will have to find three Eggs of Knowing and pass their
tests to collect 3 Sunken Keys. To the Northwest is the test of might, which requires you to collect 7 ghoul teeth by killing
ghouls. Around and to the north is the test of spirit which requires you to ascend the nearby floating pillars and navigate an
elevated walkway to find a halo in a box. The third test is to the northeast which requires you to solve a riddle. Once you have
the three keys move all the way northwest to the sunken gate.
<br>
Inside, take the elevator to the sunken angel who informs you your dreams are sealed in a place called the Den of Worms.
To open the den you will need 7 keys. One of which you should have gotten from the Lytle Spirits. The others are held by
several corrupted spirits. They teach you the ritual of 7 candles which can lift the curse from these spirits.
<br>
Once you learned the spell, return to the Sunken City. Go all the way north by the egg who gives you the test of spirit. Enter
the door to the north and find the first corrupted spirit. Surround them with 7 candles and cast your spell of redemption.
They will return to a normal form and thank you. They will give you one of the Worm Keys which you need.

<h4>6: Swamp Town</h4>
You now have 2/7 keys needed to open the Den of Worms. Leave Ocean Town and take the boat to the south.
You will find a swampy island with a half submerged gate. This is the Swamp. Enter, and move to the east.
Make sure you have 7 candles. Head all the way east to the Lord Frog. Enter Lord Frog's belly.
<br><br>
Inside the belly, you will have to navigate a maze to find the room with the torment spirit. Right, left, right.
Surround the vessel with 7 candles and cast your redemption spell. Have the recovered spirit give you your key.

<h4> 7: Back to Subyrds </h4>
There is a key located in the Subyrds, which is an area to the east of the Moon Temple. Return to Byrd Town
and the Moon Temple and find the Subyrds. Once you find the Subyrds, you must find the center house.
Head north, west, north, east across a bridge to get there. Inside is a tormented spirit you must
deal with to recover its key.

<h4> 8: Oasis Town </h4>
To the northwest of Byrd Town is Oasis Town. Enter the desert and hatch a worm egg. Clean up the town a bit.
To the very south of the town is a door leading to the open desert. To the far north is the entrance to the pyramid.
You will have to enter the pyramid and climb to the top-center doorway. It is a bit of a maze. Start
by moving toward the northwest corner. In the upper room you will find the tormented spirit.

<h4> 9: Volcano Town </h4>
Volcano town is in the southwest of the map. You must first scale the mountain which is
filled with dripping lava. It is a challenge. Once you get to the town at the top, you
will have to hatch another worm egg. Climb to the top of the town and enter the door
which leads into the volcano. You will have to drop down several levels before you
enter the maze. To find the tormented spirit in the heart of the volcano,
hang left along the extruding walls and go as far south as you can. The doorway to
the inner chamber is hidden directly to the center-south of the entrance.

<h4> 10: The Underworld </h4>
One of the keys is held by Osiris, gatekeeper of the underworld. You may enter the underworld
when you die in the Astral Plane. You must pay a price to be allowed into the hall of the dead, a certain number of
flowers. When you can pay, enter and head north to meet Osiris. He has lost a certain
body part in the labyrinth and asks you to retrieve it. Walk down the western fork to the labyrinth, which is another
giant maze. What you are looking for is hidden to the southwest of where you start. Head as far in that direction as you can.
When you find it, return it to Osiris and he will give you a key.

<h4> 11: Return to the Angel </h4>
Once you have all 7 keys, return to the Sunken Angel and they will teach you how to open
the Den of Worms. Then you may save your dreams from being eaten.
